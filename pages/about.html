                Who am I?
            </h2>
            <p>
                My name is Deandre van Rooyen and I have always been drawn to computers since I was 5.
                I started out with gaming and got intrigued by the world of coding when I was around grade 10.
                Ever since I've played around with small scripts in C# until I started dedicating real time into learning Python where I made my first ever program.
                From there I was hooked. 
                <br>
                <br>I dived more into other languages like Html, Javascript, Sql etc and knew this was the career for me.
                I'm of course an avid nerd with one of my favourite activities being World of Warcraft, but I also love to exercise. Languages has always drawn me as well and I've spent some time learning basic German but
                I need to get back into that.
                <br>
                <br>Learning to code has been such a journey and I'm also looking for opportunities to improve in the field and I'm always willing to give up time to do so.
